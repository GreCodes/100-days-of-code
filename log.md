# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 24, Friday 
### Day 1: September 25, Sunday
### Day 2: September 26, Monday
### Day 3: September 27, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished small project by FreeCodeCamp: Learn CSS flexbox by building a photo gallery. (https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/)

I've been working on my website. For some reason I cannot get the CSS to work. It looks more like a blog now. Still no navbar.

**Thoughts:** I need to practice more. I am happy I could follow instructions from FreeCodeCamp, but I need to remember so many functionalities.

### Day 4: September 28, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I wanted to use vintage colors in my website. So, I found some really cool palettes, and I decided for the purplish tonalities. I also found the reason why my CSS code was not working. Changing one letter made the difference.

**Thoughts**: No idea how my website will look like. The idea was that I was going to build an ecommerce website, but I am starting with the easiest code lines.

### Day 6: September 29, Thursday
  **Today's Progress**: I added a navbar and did some changes on my website but  I didn't save the progress, so unfortunately, I have to start all over again.
  
**Thoughts**: I am getting there. It is looking like a blog now though. But Now I want to build a personal website and blog of my life as an adventurous traveller in Europe. There is so much to tell...
  It's 23:56, so I start all over again, and upload my code files to GitHub. Then you can see I am really making some progress.

  ### Day 5: September 30 Friday! 
  **Today's Progress**: I noticed I didn't read the instructions properly. The code should be uploaded here!!.  I have just uploaded my code on this repository. I hope it is properly saved and in the right location. 
  
  I have just created a new folder and added my HTML and CSS files.

  ### Day 6: October 1 Saturday
  **Today's Progress**: I used GitHub's dev online tool but I have no idea how to get the code uploaded onto this GitHub folder. I added a navbar, a picture and I continued working on my <em>blog</em>. I also  made the navbar a bit transparent. Are the colors ok? Too Barbie-like, but perhaps they don't fit the travelling/personal blog I wish to build. Nevertheless, I think I already know the direction I want to pursue.
**The last days have been very difficult for our family, so I may not be connected during the week**

  
**Thoughts**: I want to host my website on GitHub, so it's live!
Should I also translate my content into Spanish? I mean this is my native language.
Do people understand what Aventurera Del Sur means?
