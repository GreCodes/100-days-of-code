# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 27, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished small project by FreeCodeCamp: Learn CSS flexbox by building a photo gallery. (https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/)

I've been working on my website. For some reason I cannot get the CSS to work. It looks more like a blog now. Still no navbar.

**Thoughts:** I need to practice more. I am happy I could follow instructions from FreeCodeCamp, but I need to remember so many functionalities.

### Day 2: September 28, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I wanted to use vintage colors in my website. So, I found some really cool palettes, and I decided for the purplish tonalities. I also found the reason why my CSS code was not working. Changing one letter made the difference.

**Thoughts**: No idea how my website will look like. The idea was that I was going to build an ecommerce website, but I am starting with the easiest code lines.

### Day 3: September 29, Thursday
  **Today's Progress**: I added a navbar and did some changes on my website but  I didn't save the progress, so unfortunately, I have to start all over again.
  
**Thoughts**: I am getting there. It is looking like a blog now though. But Now I want to build a personal website and blog of my life as an adventurous traveller in Europe. There is so much to tell...
  It's 23:56, so I start all over again, and upload my code files to GitHub. Then you can see I am really making some progress.

  ### Day 4: September 30 Friday! 
  **Today's Progress**: I noticed I didn't read the instructions properly. The code should be uploaded here!!.  I have just uploaded my code on this repository. I hope it is properly saved and in the right location. 
  
  I have just created a new folder and added my HTML and CSS files.

  ### Day 5: October 1 Saturday
  **Today's Progress**: I used GitHub's dev online tool but I have no idea how to get the code uploaded onto this GitHub folder. I added a navbar, a picture and I continued working on my <em>blog</em>. I also  made the navbar a bit transparent. Are the colors ok? Too Barbie-like, but perhaps they don't fit the travelling/personal blog I wish to build. Nevertheless, I think I already know the direction I want to pursue.
**The last days have been very difficult for our family, so I may not be connected during the week**

  
**Thoughts**: I want to host my website on GitHub, so it's live!
Should I also translate my content into Spanish? I mean this is my native language.
Do people understand what Aventurera Del Sur means?

 ### Day 6: October 21 Tuesday
 
  **Today's Progress**: There's a lot going on in my life lately. Today I went back to JavaScript. Just practicing variables and console.log
  Happy because Coursera is  supporting me (again) with free courses. I am very grateful to be virtually attending Meta's Front End Development Course.
  I am learning Javascript. 

  
**Thoughts**: Today I practiced declaring variables. I am uploading my progress to codepen.io
I was a bit sleepy and I missed how to separate strings from variables, so when my code was run, they were not separated. Something like "HiIamGreCodes". I was using the + symbol but it didn't help much, later I tried giving one space before and after the "" in every string. Something like in:"now says" :


console.log(petCat," now says " ,catSound);

It worked but it took me some time. Then I remember the commas made the space. Issue solved!

 ### Day 7: October 22 Saturday
 
  **Today's Progress**: Today I studied advanced operators and I remembered the first times I connected to the internet. It was in 2001 and with dial-up!
  I remember Geocities websites in Comic Sans font. 
  For some reason I remember a song I heard for the first time in 2000, and it has been playing non-stop in my head. 
  The song is Hello World, by Belgian-Spanish singer Belle Perez. 
  It is such a happy song! So, life should be fun for everyone. 
  In her honor I recreated a 90s-early 2000s website with some Javascript alerts. The reason is that I remember in 2001, I was clicking non-stop a random Mexican guy's   website. I must have clicked on it more than 50 times. 
  
  
**Thoughts**: 


  I practiced more JS variables and advanced operators. 
  I had a lot of fun using html and css. 
  
  Tomorrow I have to start designing my mother's website. She wants to make her pottery art available for everybody. 
  I have full freedom to build it.
