# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 24, 2022 

Hi Coders!
So, my life has been quite hectic for the last 4 months. We moved to Copenhagen from Munich, and Ive been with my children 24/7 while my husband goes to work. 
I am the mother of 2 toddlers, who are full of energy. I guess you can imagine how my day looks like. No time! I cannot concentrate on anything besides making sure they are safe and sound. I have a side hustle, an etsy shop, in which I sell vintage goods. It has been a life saver for the last years, but Etsy take a lot of fees!
So, itÂ¡s time to start a webshop. I already know a bit of HTML and CSS but I am very rusty, therefore, I must reimmerse into this world again.
My goal is to land a web-developer role here in Denmark.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
