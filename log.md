# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 27, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished small project by FreeCodeCamp: Learn CSS flexbox by building a photo gallery. (https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/)

I've been working on my website. For some reason I cannot get the CSS to work. It looks more like a blog now. Still no navbar.

**Thoughts:** I need to practice more. I am happy I could follow instructions from FreeCodeCamp, but I need to remember so many functionalities.

### Day 2: September 28, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I wanted to use vintage colors in my website. So, I found some really cool palettes, and I decided for the purplish tonalities. I also found the reason why my CSS code was not working. Changing one letter made the difference.

**Thoughts**: No idea how my website will look like. The idea was that I was going to build an ecommerce website, but I am starting with the easiest code lines.

### Day 3: September 29, Thursday
  **Today's Progress**: I added a navbar and did some changes on my website but  I didn't save the progress, so unfortunately, I have to start all over again.
  
**Thoughts**: I am getting there. It is looking like a blog now though. But Now I want to build a personal website and blog of my life as an adventurous traveller in Europe. There is so much to tell...
  It's 23:56, so I start all over again, and upload my code files to GitHub. Then you can see I am really making some progress.

  ### Day 4: September 30 Friday! 
  **Today's Progress**: I noticed I didn't read the instructions properly. The code should be uploaded here!!.  I have just uploaded my code on this repository. I hope it is properly saved and in the right location. 
  
  I have just created a new folder and added my HTML and CSS files.

  ### Day 5: October 1 Saturday
  **Today's Progress**: I used GitHub's dev online tool but I have no idea how to get the code uploaded onto this GitHub folder. I added a navbar, a picture and I continued working on my <em>blog</em>. I also  made the navbar a bit transparent. Are the colors ok? Too Barbie-like, but perhaps they don't fit the travelling/personal blog I wish to build. Nevertheless, I think I already know the direction I want to pursue.
**The last days have been very difficult for our family, so I may not be connected during the week**

  
**Thoughts**: I want to host my website on GitHub, so it's live!
Should I also translate my content into Spanish? I mean this is my native language.
Do people understand what Aventurera Del Sur means?

 ### Day 6: October 21 Tuesday
 
  **Today's Progress**: There's a lot going on in my life lately. Today I went back to JavaScript. Just practicing variables and console.log
  Happy because Coursera is  supporting me (again) with free courses. I am very grateful to be virtually attending Meta's Front End Development Course.
  I am learning Javascript. 

  
**Thoughts**: Today I practiced declaring variables. I am uploading my progress to codepen.io
I was a bit sleepy and I missed how to separate strings from variables, so when my code was run, they were not separated. Something like "HiIamGreCodes". I was using the + symbol but it didn't help much, later I tried giving one space before and after the "" in every string. Something like in:"now says" :


console.log(petCat," now says " ,catSound);

It worked but it took me some time. Then I remember the commas made the space. Issue solved!

 ### Day 7: October 22 Saturday
 
  **Today's Progress**: Today I studied advanced operators and I remembered the first times I connected to the internet. It was in 2001 and with dial-up!
  I remember Geocities websites in Comic Sans font. 
  For some reason I remember a song I heard for the first time in 2000, and it has been playing non-stop in my head. 
  The song is Hello World, by Belgian-Spanish singer Belle Perez. 
  It is such a happy song! So, life should be fun for everyone. 
  In her honor I recreated a 90s-early 2000s website with some Javascript alerts. The reason is that I remember in 2001, I was clicking non-stop a random Mexican guy's   website. I must have clicked on it more than 50 times. 
  
  
**Thoughts**: 


  I practiced more JS variables and advanced operators. 
  I had a lot of fun using html and css. 
  
  Tomorrow I have to start designing my mother's website. She wants to make her pottery art available for everybody. 
  I have full freedom to build it.

### Day 8: October 26 Wednesday 2022
 
  **Today's Progress**:
  
 I've been doing many things these days. I was logging my progress here but it seems a didn't commit changes.
 I will count it as a day because I was not coding all the time. 
 
 I learned a bit of Markdown! It is super simple and handy. I remember we used a similar format (or maybe the same) for the Wikis I wrote while in college. 
 I practiced the for and while lopps in JavaScript.
  
**Thoughts**: 


JavaScript continues to be difficult to grasp. Hopefully I can start using it in my projects soon. I have to watch out for the spaces though. Sometimes the code doesn't work if you don't leave spaces or viceversa.
I should start building that pottery webshop for my mother.

### Day 9: November 9 Wednesday 2022
 
  **Today's Progress**:
  
Learning . I've been learning Arrays, Objects and Functions (Object Literals and the Dot, and the Brackets Notation).

So, arrays are objects, with their own built-in properties and methods.
push() and pop() are the most commonly used methods. I was practicing using my children names ( this way I remember).

var children = [];
children.push("Luna");
children.push("Sunna"); 

If I want to remove the last item ("Sunna"), I can use the pop() method: 
children.pop ();
console.log(children); 

Arrays are iterable
Strings are also iterable.

I learned about concatenation ( joining strings together).

var parting = "Goodbye";
var name = "Robin";

The following can be used to return both of these values as a combined string: 

console.log( parting + name );
console.log( parting.concat(name) );

I also learned about the property length,and methods:  chatAt(), concat(), indexOf(), lastIndexOf(), Split(), toUpperCase() and toLowerCase().

var greet = "Hello, ";
var place = "World"

greet.length; //7
greet.charAt(0): //H ----- It reads the individual chracter at a specific index in a string starting from zero.
"Wo".concat("rl").concat("d"); // World ------ This method joins two strings.
"ho-ho-ho".indexOf('-'); //2-----This method returns the location of the first position that matches a character.
"ho-ho-ho".split("-"); // ['ho', 'ho', 'ho'] ------This method chops up the string into an array of sub-strings.

greet.toUpperCase(); // "HELLO, " ----------
greet.toLowerCase(); // "hello, " ---------- Both methods change the casing of strings.

To create a new empty array literals, we use: 

var children = []

To create a new empty object literal and assign it to the variable favCar, we use:

var favDrink = {};

Remember: An object consists of key-value pairs, known as properties.

**Thoughts**: 

I still feel JavaScript is very confusing.
