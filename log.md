### Day 0: September 24, 2022 


### Day 1: September 25, Sunday
### Day 2: September 26, Monday
### Day 3: September 27, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Finished small project by FreeCodeCamp: Learn CSS flexbox by building a photo gallery. (https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/)

I've been working on my website. For some reason I cannot get the CSS to work. It looks more like a blog now. Still no navbar.

**Thoughts:** I need to practice more. I am happy I could follow instructions from FreeCodeCamp, but I need to remember so many functionalities.

### Day 4: September 28, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I wanted to use vintage colors in my website. So, I found some really cool palettes, and I decided for the purplish tonalities. I also found the reason why my CSS code was not working. Changing one letter made the difference.

**Thoughts**: No idea how my website will look like. The idea was that I was going to build an ecommerce website, but I am starting with the easiest code lines.

### Day 6: September 29, Thursday
  **Today's Progress**: I added a navbar and did some changes on my website but  I didn't save the progress, so unfortunately, I have to start all over again.
  
**Thoughts**: I am getting there. It is looking like a blog now though. But Now I want to build a personal website and blog of my life as an adventurous traveller in Europe. There is so much to tell...
  It's 23:56, so I start all over again, and upload my code files to GitHub. Then you can see I am really making some progress.
