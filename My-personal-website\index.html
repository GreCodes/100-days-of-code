    <h1>Hello amazing world</h1>
    <p>Hi, earthlings! So here I am, without internet at 23:44. It was a rough day with the toddlers, and I am falling
        asleep.</p>
    <p> 2 days ago, I signed up for the <a href="http://www.100daysofcode.com">#100DaysOfCode</a> challenge, and
        my idea was to start building my very own Ecommerce platform for the vintage items I sell on my Etsy shop, <a
            href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/TheRetroRatEtsy">The Retro Rat Etsy</a>. The reason behind is that the last
        months, my
        sales
        have been increasing, and so are Etsy fees. Therefore I need to find my own way to sell my products, so that I
        don't
        depend on Etsy anymore and I suffer from their high fees.</p>

    <p>The articles sold are mostly rare finds and collectibles, and normally their prices range from 50 EUR to 399 EUR.
        Yep, not cheap stuff. </p>

        <p>Now, going back to the challenge. The idea is that I write code everyday during 100 days for at least 2 hours, and I document it. 
           I am indeed documenting this amazing journey on <a href="http://www.github.com/grecodes/100daysofcode">GitHub account</a>. 
            How  awesome is that? </p>
            <p>I have taught myself some HTML and CSS. However, for the last months, my life has been quite difficult in this new <a href="http://www.wikipedia.com/copenhagen">city</a>
                that I need to review some knowledge, as well as learning new skills</p>
        <p>And, as I have already mentioned, I am the mother of two toddlers of 3 and 1, and OMG, that's pretty hardcore! 
<br> These are my girls, Luna and Sunna. Aren't they lovely and wonderful? <br>
<p>At the moment, I am taking Meta's front end development course offered by <a href="https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/meta-front-end-developer">Coursera</a>.</p>
    <p>I was fortunate enough to receive finacial aid= free course!</p>
