    <h1>Hello amazing world</h1>
    <p>Hi, earthlings! So here I am, without internet at 23:44. It was a rough day with the toddlers, and I am falling
        asleep.</p>
    <p> 2 days ago, I signed up for the <a href="http://www.100daysofcode.com">#100DaysOfCode</a> challenge, and
        my idea was to start building my very own Ecommerce platform for the vintage items I sell on my Etsy shop, <a
            href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/TheRetroRatEtsy">The Retro Rat Etsy</a>. The reason behind is that the last
        months, my
        sales
        have been increasing, and so are Etsy fees. Therefore I need to find my own way to sell my products, so that I
        don't
        depend on Etsy anymore and I suffer from their high fees.</p>

    <p>The articles sold are mostly rare finds and collectibles, and normally their prices range from 50 EUR to 399 EUR.
        Yep, not cheap stuff. </p>

        <p>Now, going back to the challenge. The idea is that I write code everyday during 100 days for at least 2 hours, and I document it. 
           I am indeed documenting this amazing journey on <a href="http://www.github.com/grecodes/100daysofcode">GitHub account</a>. 
            How  awesome is that? </p>
            <p>I have taught myself some HTML and CSS. However, for the last months, my life has been quite difficult in this new <a href="http://www.wikipedia.com/copenhagen">city</a>
                that I need to review some knowledge, as well as learning new skills</p>
        <p>And, as I have already mentioned, I am the mother of two toddlers of 3 and 1, and OMG, that's pretty hardcore! 
<br> These are my girls, Luna and Sunna. Aren't they lovely and wonderful? <br>

<p>At the moment, I am taking Meta's front end development course offered by <a href="https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/meta-front-end-developer">Coursera</a>.</p>
    <p>I was fortunate enough to receive finacial aid= free course!</p>

<h1>Why Aventurera Del Sur?</h1>

<p>So, I was in The Netherlands, stranded. I lost my passport on a short trip to Amsterdam. I noticed 2 days after, and I was in complete shock! I had to travel to Berlin soon to start a new chapter in my life.  My new passport with a German visa.
<br>I was lucky to have free accommodation in a huge house though, and while I waited more than a month for this passport, I improvised melodies and a song was born : " Aventurera del Sur, les digo que la vida, la vida es una cancion". I jotted it down and I recorded it on my computer. 
I still have to ask my friend Robinson, to lend me a hand to record it<em>the way it should be</em>. 
By then, October 2014, I was thinking about all the adventures I have lived in the countries I have visited and stayed. <br>A song conforted me. <br>
<p>I am certain, travellers and expats will identify with the intensity of experiences lived abroad. I guess sometimes we feel like in our own movie.</p>


<h3>It's a sad world<h3>
  <h1>
    When a close one leaves this earth</h1>
                                          
<p>Talking about death is not a taboo for me. At 27, I was about to leave this world due to an internal hemorrhage. One of my ovaries was profusedly bleeding and my toraxic cavity was filling up with blood. And this took place just out of the blue.</p>
  
  <em>I survived.</em><br>
  <p> After that experience, I am always aware, your most love ones can just leave this earthly world in the blink of an eye</p> <p> Young, old, rich, poor, death can always visit you</p>
  
 <p>Now, imagine that delicate moment. A family member passes and you are in another continent, with a weeks old baby and no money for a flight ticket.</p> <p> That was me in 2019, when my father died from an aortic aneurysm.</p>
  <p> I know he would have said 
    <em>Stay there with your family"</em>
      , but the guilt was eating me inside.</p>
  <em> I stayed.</em> <br>
  
  <p> One of the very few friends I have attended his funeral, and my cousin took a message. </p>
  
  <p>One of the reasons, and the most important we move to Denmark, was that we would be closer to the family. </p> <p> And even though <em>farfar</em> or grandpa doesn't live in Copenhagen, we often visit him.</p>
  
  <p>He will leave us very soon</p>
  <p>How can I explain my daughter when he is gone?
  </p> <p> How do I tell her <em>"Luna, he is not home anymore, we cannot visit him and go for a walk
  again</em>
  <p>Sometimes I regret not starting younger having children, so that their grandparents would have more time with them </p>
  
  <p>And we should love each other and show it every day</p>
